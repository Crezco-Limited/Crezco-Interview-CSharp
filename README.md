# Crezco C# Pairing Interview

## Setup

You can clone this repository using:
`git clone https://github.com/Crezco-Limited/Crezco-Interview-CSharp.git`

The repository contains a single project where all of your code will live. 

Once complete the interviewer will ask you to push your code as a new branch. If you would prefer not to do that with your public Github user, or you do not have a Github user account, that's ok, just zip it up and share it some other way.

## The Task

Please create an ASP.NET web application with a single REST endpoint for retrieving information about an IP address.

This information should be saved locally.

Testing should be included as part of your solution.

Please use sensible abstractions, validation, and error handling for these components.

Once this is complete, create an endpoint for reporting data from the API.
