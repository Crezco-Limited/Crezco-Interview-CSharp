# Crezco C# Pairing Interview

## Setup

You can clone this repository using:
`git clone https://github.com/Crezco-Limited/Crezco-Interview-CSharp.git`

The repository contains a single project where all of your code will live. 

Once complete the interviewer will ask you to push your code as a new branch. If you would prefer not to do that with your public Github user, or you do not have a Github user account, that's ok, just zip it up and share it some other way.

## The Task

Please create an ASP.NET web application to retrieve information about an IP address and report on our data. We will be pulling information about IP addresses into our application from a third party web service.

This information should be saved locally.

Testing should be included as part of your solution.

Please use sensible abstractions, validation, and error handling for these components.

Once this is complete, create an endpoint for reporting data from the API.
